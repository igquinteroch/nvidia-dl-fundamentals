# NVIDIA Deep Learning Fundamentals 🧠

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks from the **NVIDIA Deep Learning Fundamentals** workshop, completed as part of the course Advanced Machine Learning Methods (TC5033.10) from my master's degree program in Artificial Intelligence.

The workshop was provided through NVIDIA’s Deep Learning Institute (DLI), and facilitated by [Jose Antonio Cantoral-Ceballos, Ph.D](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacantoral/), a certified NVIDIA instructor.


## 📘 Course Overview

The **Deep Learning Fundamentals** course offers a practical, hands-on introduction to deep learning using PyTorch and GPU acceleration. Learners build foundational knowledge by developing and training neural networks on real-world datasets.

### 💡 Learning Objectives

- Learn the fundamental techniques and tools required to train a deep learning model
- Gain experience with common deep learning data types and model architectures
- Enhance datasets through data augmentation to improve model accuracy
- Leverage transfer learning between models to achieve efficient results with less data and computation
- Build confidence to take on your own project with a modern deep learning framework


## 🗂️ Notebooks

Each notebook corresponds to a specific module or topic in the course:

- [`01-mnist.ipynb`](https://github.com/igquinteroch/nvidia-dl-fundamentals/blob/main/01_mnist.ipynb) – Image Classification with the MNIST Dataset
- [`02-asl.ipynb`](https://github.com/igquinteroch/nvidia-dl-fundamentals/blob/main/02_asl.ipynb) – Image Classification of an American Sign Language Dataset
- [`03-asl_cnn.ipynb`](https://github.com/igquinteroch/nvidia-dl-fundamentals/blob/main/03_asl_cnn.ipynb) – Convolutional Neural Networks
- [`04a-asl_augmentation.ipynb`](https://github.com/igquinteroch/nvidia-dl-fundamentals/blob/main/04a_asl_augmentation.ipynb) – Data Augmentation 
- [`04b_asl_predictions.ipynb`](https://github.com/igquinteroch/nvidia-dl-fundamentals/blob/main/04b_asl_predictions.ipynb) – Deploying Your Model
- [`05a_doggy_door`](https://github.com/igquinteroch/nvidia-dl-fundamentals/blob/main/05a_doggy_door.ipynb) – Pre-Trained Models
- [`05b_presidential_doggy_door`](https://github.com/igquinteroch/nvidia-dl-fundamentals/blob/main/05b_presidential_doggy_door.ipynb) - Transfer Learning
- [`06_nlp.ipynb`](https://github.com/igquinteroch/nvidia-dl-fundamentals/blob/main/06_nlp.ipynb) - Natural Language Processing
- [`07_assessment.ipynb`](https://github.com/igquinteroch/nvidia-dl-fundamentals/blob/main/07_assessment.ipynb) - Assessment: Object Classification

These notebooks serve both as course notes and a personal reference for applying core DL concepts.

Note: The notebook `06_nlp.ipynb` was not covered during the workshop due to time constraints. However, the content about NLP was introduced during the course Advanced Machine Learning Methods (TC5033.10) from my master's degree program.


## 🧰 Requirements

- Python
- Pandas
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebooks familiarity
- Each participant was provided with dedicated access to a fully configured, GPU-accelerated server in the cloud.


## 🏅 Certification
