# NVIDIA Deep Learning Fundamentals 🧠

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks from the **NVIDIA Deep Learning Fundamentals** workshop, completed as part of the course Advanced Machine Learning Methods (TC5033.10) from my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence. The workshop was provided through NVIDIA’s Deep Learning Institute (DLI), and facilitated by [Jose Antonio Cantoral-Ceballos, Ph.D](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacantoral/), a certified NVIDIA instructor.

## 📘 Course Overview

The **Deep Learning Fundamentals** course offers a practical, hands-on introduction to deep learning using PyTorch and GPU acceleration. Learners build foundational knowledge by developing and training neural networks on real-world datasets.
